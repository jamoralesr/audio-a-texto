I've added audio playback and download functionality to the edit recording page. Here's what I implemented:

1. **Enhanced the Recording Form**:
   - Added a custom view component for the audio player that's only visible on the edit page
   - Improved the display of file size (now shows in MB instead of bytes)
   - Improved the display of duration (now shows in HH:MM:SS format instead of seconds)
2. **Created a Custom Audio Player View**:
   - Added an HTML5 audio player with controls for playback
   - Included a download button styled to match Filament's design
   - Added proper error handling if no audio file is available
   - Used the record's actual file path and MIME type for proper playback

The audio player appears in the "Archivo de Audio" section of the edit form, allowing users to:

- Play the audio recording directly in the browser
- Control playback (play, pause, seek, volume)
- Download the original audio file with a single click

This implementation ensures that users can only access their own recordings due to the access control we previously implemented, maintaining the security requirement that users should only see their own content.
